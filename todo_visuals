Kaggle's Data Visualization Course: Free, interactive, and excellent for getting hands-on with Seaborn.

The Matplotlib Official Tutorials: The "Anatomy of a Figure" and "Lifecycle of a Plot" pages are gold.

The Seaborn Official Tutorial and Gallery: The gallery is the best place to find the plot you need and see the code that generated it.

Practice, Practice, Practice
You can't learn this by reading alone.

Kaggle Datasets: Pick a dataset that interests you (e.g., "Netflix Movies and TV Shows," "Video Game Sales"). Formulate three business questions and use this framework to answer them in a notebook.

TidyTuesday: A weekly data project from the R community (but you can use Python!). They provide a new, interesting, and often messy dataset every week. It's fantastic practice.

MakeoverMonday: Similar to TidyTuesday. They provide a dataset and an existing visualization. Your job is to improve it. This hones your critical eye.
